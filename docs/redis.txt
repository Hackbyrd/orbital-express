Download Your Version of Redis Here:
http://download.redis.io/releases/

After downloading upgraded redis, you must run make command
cd redis-x.x.x
make
make test

Next, change the folder "redis.x.x.x" name to just "redis".
Then create a file inside the "redis" folder called "vX.X.X.txt" with your version number to keep track of what version you have.
Note, this file is ONLY local to you and is included in the .gitignore. So all new developers will have to go through these steps in install a local version of redis

Start Server:
yarn redis
or
src/redis-server
